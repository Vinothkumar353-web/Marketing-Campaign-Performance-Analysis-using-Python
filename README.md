## 📊 Key Metrics & Calculations

| Metric           | Formula                                  | Description                            |
|------------------|-------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|
| ROI              | `(Revenue - Cost) / Cost`                 | Measures profitability of a campaign   |
| Conversion Rate  | `Conversions / Clicks`                    | Tracks campaign effectiveness          |
| Engagement Score | `((Clicks / Impressions) * 100)`          | Measures user engagement               |
